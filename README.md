# Karobari

The name of our application is “Karobari” which means “Businessman”. Today everyone wants to earn and wants to become a successful businessman but not knowing the supply chain restricts them, so our aim is to provide anyone who wants to start a business with a free online market tool where they can create listings as per their selling and/or buying needs thus creating business to business lead generation. This trading platform boasts of features such as public post listing which would enable them to extend their customer base throughout the users in India who are a part of the supply chain. There would also be geolocation filters so that the user can target a specific area or a broader market as per his requirements and inventory.

People would be able to search these listings for specific products as per their domains and interested buyers can request to contact the seller for purchase or for further negotiations as per the requirement.This feature would be subject to lister's discretion which means contact details would only be provided by lister's permissions. This will help people become independent by eliminating the requirements of the supply chain and focus only on managing their business inventory by buying products favoring the quality and cost effectiveness as per their customers' needs.

The users on the platform would first be screened manually for verification and after successful verification would be allowed to access the platform. The application will also have a rating system for verified users based on the number of trades carried out successfully depending upon the buyer’s satisfaction and sellers ability to fulfil the requirement. The rating system can have more criteria depending upon the discussions on each domain individually.

The reference based model of our application would be helpful in tracking down scammers since the user would be verified manually before they could access the platform. We believe that a person's privacy is invaluable and hence our application takes utmost care to protect user data however in case of illegal activity by the user the personal information would be shared to the appropriate authority.

The platform would be customised as per the specific domains like agriculture, sericulture, horticulture, raw materials, gems and jewellery and many more. This home grown application would have the ability to boost Indian economy by uplifting the common businessman. This will enable the creation of a much needed level playing field for all the traders. There would be no need to have connections in the supply chain and any such contact based prerequisites. This will also help in ensuring fair play as "Big Players" won’t be able to influence the market.
